# Math Flash Cards

##This is a simple web-based, mobile-first flash card game for kids learning math. 

The purpose was to provide parents with a flash card game to play with elementary-aged children during COVID-19 quarantine/isolation. This repository can be cloned and run using `npm start`, or maybe accessed at http://math-flash-cards.com.

When the page loads for the first time, you will be presented with the first problem, an answer area and 10 numeric buttons. The answer area may be edited directly, or the buttons may be pressed to play. 

All problems are presented in order, starting with `0 times 0-9`. Once the zeroes are complete, the player is presented with `1 times 0-9`, and so on. Each card is saved to localStorage, which means **that** browser on **that** device will remember your place.

By clicking/tapping the menu button at the top right, the cards can be restarted by clicking/tapping `START OVER`. The cards can be randomized by clicking/tapping `RANDOMIZE`.

  - Currently only supports Multiplication. More operations to come.
  - What you see was built in an afternoon. I'll keep working on it through the quarantine.
